"The father of Sergei Einsenstein, the film maker","I thought this was very mediocre. They had attempted to recreate the experience of an art nouveau house - it was stuff, claustrophobic and I learnt nothing. Mikhail Einstenstien‘s son, Segei was arguably the most important film maker of the twentieth century who created the cinematic view in architecture too. An understanding of that would have helped enormously along with architectural plans of the buildings.",Dec 2024 • Friends,3.0 of 5 bubbles

Fantastic,"Incredible collection of Art Nouveau buildings here in Alberta Iela but also in all the adjoining streets and even beyond. You get a crick in your neck but it's worth it just to admire the imagination of the architects and the skill of the builders in creating such a fascinating district. And how fortunate the war never destroyed it.

Classic Art Nouveau architecture with charming and amusing details,"Eminently walkable Riga rewards your urban treks in many ways.  The stroll from Old Town through the pleasing and varied Kronvalda Park, with its treelined paths, statues, and playgrounds, brings you to Alberta Iela, the justly reknowned Art Nouveau street in an upscale residential neighborhood.One building after another sparkles with interest, but only if you take your time to notice the myriad carved stone details – charming, amusing, and even ribald.  It would be easy to just glide past these treasures, head down, quickly rushing toward another destination thinking this was just another street with turn of the 20th Century apartment blocks like you find in many other major cities.  However, as one of the major cities of the Russian Empire, Riga connected to international artistic trends, embraced Art Nouveau to a greater degree than any other city and developed its own variants.  The style accounts for one third of all of the buildings in central Riga – the highest such concentration in the world.This history has some interest unto itself, but the history and the fact that its Art Nouveau landmarks contributed to Riga’s designation as a UNESCO’s World Cultural Heritage site wouldn’t be much if it were not for the breathtaking stylistic breadth, creativity and beauty of the buildings.  They drive the real interest; but only if you pause and take the time to look up and see the stone decorative elements at the corners, along the roof line, and framing the doors and windows.  An endless array of stone carvings – some grand and some tiny, some ravishing and some charming, some grim and some fanciful.When you return to the other parts of the city, keep your Art Nouveau eyes peeled.  Thanks to Alberta Iela, you will see much more.",Sep 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles

The roads are small and quiet, especially  by night, there are interesting small restaurants and cafe's with their own concept - it sports a cigar tasting shop with a most amicable senior lady host who speaks English and serves beer at very good prices, there is friendliness in the air and the client may stay long ( have written about them earlier this year - maybe in April/May). The ornaments on the few houses we speak of are rich in imagination, if not a Gaudi - still beautiful and in great condition again. If you go to the adjacent street Elisabete near Antonijas, you have a nice blue/grey house and if on the fringe of the Old Town, the French Embassy - it makes your heart beat faster...and my French connections stir...you wish to stand and look for hours..and time loses its consequences..",Aug 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles

Best of Art Noveau Architectures,We visited Riga in May 2018 and we were so taken by the architectural richness of the city.  It has the greatest concentration of Art Nouveau-style architecture of any city we have ever been and it is truly a feast for the eyes!  We learned so much about Art Nouveau and the main figures who were instrumental in shaping this movement.  Alberta and Elizabetes Iela are full of fine examples of Eisenstadt's works and our guide did an extraordinary job in pointing out various expressions of the period style ranging from the more classical to ornate to whimsical motifs. We signed up for the tour at the spur-of-the-moment at the Tourist Info Office (main square) and we were lucky they were able to accommodate us.

Одно  из самых замечательных мест. Must see!!!,"We visited Riga in August 2018. Alberta Street is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited at all. The beauty of the buildings is so impressive that you think it's not real !!! Tourists stand in front of every building and take pictures! And this is a whole street !! Hard to imagine, must see.",Sep 2018 • Couples,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Beautiful. Amazing spots for dining.,"Beautiful street. Buildings made in Jugendstyle. Cozy, calm area with a whole lot of great cafes and restaurants.",Sep 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Nothing special,I went there because I’ve heard a lot about it. But when arriving I was surprised. First I wandered around asking people how to find the street they were all saying I was on it. I didn’t get that it was just few nice buildings and nothing else. I guess it all depends on what you compare to but I expected more than just few houses. So don’t go far just for that. But if you are in the neighborhood then check it out.,Sep 2018 • Friends,3.0 of 5 bubbles
Beautiful architecture,The buildings are gorgeous and it’s fun to just wander on your own and enjoy them. The Art Nouveau museum has a great self guided tours. I walked from the old town and started my self tour around 10:30am.  I didn’t find the guided tours to be too obtrusive as they don’t stay in one spot for very long and I had time to linger.  I liked seeing some of the buildings covered in scaffolding in various stages of repair.,Aug 2018 • Solo,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Art Nouveau everywhere!,"A wonderful area to walk round, v quiet and quite beautiful altho a number of the buildings are being renovated there are stunning examples if Art Nouveau I'm looking forward to visiting the museum, it was closed today Monday's. There is Art Nouveau everywhere in Riga but lots around here.",Sep 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Beautiful Art Nouveau buildings,"It is a wonderful area of Riga, I wish, though, that traffic would be banned or reduced;  hordes of tourists and their guides also spoil the view and the contemplation of these works of architectural art, especially in the mornings and afternoons when cruise ships come in. If you travel individually, check out the best times to visit the sights without the hordes.",Aug 2018 • Friends,4.0 of 5 bubbles
A must see! Stunning!,"For all the Art Nouveau buildings you’ll see just walking around Riga (and there are many outstanding examples), this street and Elizabeth street are just jaw dropping. It’s worth doing some research before hand, to understand what art Nouveau is, and why Riga is so important in the Art Nouveau universe. You can take a tour-and I’m sure you’ll learn quite a bit, but the Museum of Art Nouveau has several self-guided walking tours on their website you can print out. I really needed to take my time on these streets-just to absorb what I was seeing!!! Just spectacular!",Aug 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Beautiful art nouveau buildings,"Several of the buildings were being renovated when we were there so the scaffolding and construction equipment made it difficult to see all of the buildings, but what we did see was very impressive. Hopefully it will only get better with time once renovations are done.",Aug 2018 • Family,4.0 of 5 bubbles
Jugendstil aficionados’ dream,"While Art Nouveau buildings abound in Riga, this particular street with its consistent extravagance is quite unequalled and superb. (A better camera would do justice...)",Aug 2018 • Couples,5.0 of 5 bubbles

Art nouveau street,"The street is very cool, unfortunately many buildings were under repair during our visit. If some tours pass by this street becomes easily crowded. It is a nice visit to see many art nouveau buildings, definitely worth a stop. Many of the buildings aren’t original and have been restored, but still worth the visit.",Aug 2018 • Couples,4.0 of 5 bubbles
Art Nouveau architecture and nice building deco inside and outside of buildings,"You need to explore the inside and outside of buildings in this street. It may help with a tour guide. We just visited by ourselves and found an interesting museum showing old lifestyles of Riga. However, that is a short term exhibition until end of July 2018.",Jul 2018 • Family,4.0 of 5 bubbles
Art deco architecture beautifully restored,"This is a must see for anyone interested in art deco architecture. Old buildings beautifully restored.

The Heart of Art Nouveau in Riga,"Just and ordinary street in Riga. But blessed with the most exquisite and varied Art Nouveau architecture, replete witf naked heroines, peacocks, medusas, snakes and dragons. Just keep gazing as you notice more and more fascinating decorative details. No 2a, No 4 and No 13 are highlights. Make sure you also look at the Art Nouveau Museum as well for an impression of the contemporary interiors.",Aug 2018 • Couples,5.0 of 5 bubbles

Must see,"Alberta iela, along with Elisabetes iela, is one of the key Art Nouveau/Jugendstill style places in Riga. You just have to go and enjoy the nice buildings that will appear. These buildings are quite surprising and original since their nice decoration is striking and awesome. You can reach this street very easy from the city center",Jun 2018 • Business,5.0 of 5 bubbles
Well Worth the Time to Take a Walk on Alberta and explore nearby Elizabete Streets,"Riga has numerous historic  beautiful and varied unique Art Noveau/Jugendstil buildings which are amazing to discover and behold .  Depending on time constraints, guided tour options might be best.. I personally found I preferred to wander and explore  these building facades on my own, so I could spend as much or little time as I wanted  looking AND enjoying this free curb-side attraction. I first purchased an expensive paperback  photo book  (in English)  about Riga's Jugendstil Architecture . It featured photos of many of the beautiful distinctive buildings and listed street locations. Checking a map, I found many of these  streets were near/adjacent to Alberta iela . Some are impressively ornate. Because they have been cleaned and restored, are a joy to photograph.",Jul 2018 • Solo,5.0 of 5 bubbles

Flamboyant Art Nouveau architecture,"One of the 2 streets outside the Old town of Riga you should see. A short walk from the Old Town, this street has, on one side, a series of flamboyant and expressive art nouveau buildings. They are mostly by the same architect, Eisenstein, but are all very different. Most have been very nicely renovated, and one is being renovated. At the corner is the Art Nouveau museum, pretty well hidden, and the entrance is from Strelnieku street (and you need to be buzzed in, the code is 12). The museum is a renovated art nouveau apartment, and the building has a fantastic staircase.",Jun 2018 • Couples,5.0 of 5 bubbles
